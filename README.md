# Chamalal Morphology

## Background

[Chamalal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamalal_language) is an endangered language from the Nakh-Daghestanian family.

This repository contains a Chamalal morphological analyzer. It is a part of a larger project by the students of the [School of Linguistics](https://ling.hse.ru/en/) at the NRU HSE that aims to provide digital tools for endangered languages. Morphological parsers of other Andic languages, made by my fellow students, can be found here: [Bagvalal](https://github.com/ruthenian8/bagvalal), [Andi](https://github.com/vbunt/andi).

### Grammar and lexicon

The current work is based on the grammar of Chamalal by A. A. Bokarev (1949), the Chamalal dictionary by P. T. Magomedova (1999).
